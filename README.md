# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the `/users/:id` route fails to handle cases where `:id` is not a valid number, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior. The solution provides improved error handling to gracefully manage such scenarios.

## Bug
The provided `bug.js` file contains a route that fetches a user based on their ID. However, it lacks error handling for cases where the provided ID is not a number. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to handle this issue by adding input validation and comprehensive error handling.  The solution uses `isNaN` to check if the ID is a number. If it is not, an appropriate error response is sent. If a user isn't found a 404 is returned
